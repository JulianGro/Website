**<abbr title="too long didn't read">TLDR:</abbr>** Kaiteki will not collect and submit data without the consent of the user. Kaiteki will only collect and submit data necessary to make the features work that are being used.

## Data collected and purpose

The following data will be used to make Kaiteki work and will be transmitted to the server being used with Kaiteki in order to fulfill Kaiteki's functionality at the request of the user:

- Profile information (display name, username, description/biography, metadata and other user-provided information)

- Authentication tokens
- User identity (Username, instance host and type, etc.)
- Other service tokens (Push notifications, translation, etc.)

## Data deletion

To request your data being deleted, contact your instance administrator, as Kaiteki does not administrate the services accessible within.

## Error reports

Kaiteki is capable of generating a URL that leads to GitHub with prefilled information about the error to create an issue ticket.

The form can/will contain the following data:
- Error type and message
- Stack trace

The creation of a ticket requires a GitHub account. The user has the ability to delete their issue ticket on GitHub at will.
